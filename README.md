# Public API Coding Challenge

A simple app that does the following:
 Consumes data from a public facing API
 Performs some manipulation or interrogation on the data from the API
 Outputs results of that manipulation or interrogation

Examples of this could be (don’t use these as the challenge):
 Grab weather information for the local area and display it
 Get train times for arrivals and departures from the local train station
